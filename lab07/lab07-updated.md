# Lab04 Lesson Plan

- Red Centre Lvl 2061
- 15:00

## Ice Breakers (5 min)

- How was the break?
- How are projects going?
- People who asked for more feedback in week 5.

## Demo: Functions

- Function syntax in C.
    - Return type.
    - Function name.
    - Function arguments.
    - Function body.
- How to call a function?
    - Always with `()` brackets.
    - If missing the `()` brackets, then function won't run.
- Why do we use functions?
    - It reduces repetition.
    - Because it reduces repetition, there's less chance of us making mistakes.
    - It's easier to maintain code.

## Lab: Motor Controller Interface

Only function demo is needed to do today's lab.

Get week 5's code and refactor it.

How to refactor?
1. Identify which code is being repeated or has a pattern.
1. Turn that code into a function and make the variables generic.
1. Replace the repeated code with the function.

Independent research points:
- What is a function?
- Why should we use functions?
- What are code smells?
- What is refactoring?
- History of functions.

## Further Demo: Obstacle Avoidance

- Use the ultrasonic sensor to detect if there's an obstacle.
    - We need a threshold to decide how close an obstacle is.
- Just stop moving forward if there's an obstacle and turn left until there's no more obstacle.

## Further Demo: Servo

- Ask which teams are using servos?
