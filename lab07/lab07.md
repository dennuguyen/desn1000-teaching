# Lab04 Lesson Plan

## Ice Breakers (5 min)

- How was the break?
- How are projects going?

## Servo

- What is a servo?
    - It's a motor.
- How is it different from a DC motor?
    - We use servos if we need to set the angle of a motor.
- Also different in wiring, 3 wires:
    - Red: Usually 5 V input.
    - Black: Ground.
    - Coloured: PWM signal.
- Tinkercad demo.

## Compass

- What is a compass?
    - Reads 
- Depends on the model because a library is usually provided to interface with the device.
    - I2C.

## Interrupts

Demo interrupts with different triggers.
- Requires a push button.

1. Look at code in lectures notes.
1. Measure period of USB serial at 9600 baud.
1. Program needs to use an interrupt to receive signals from USB.
1. Show the result in Serial Monitor.
1. Also show the result in Serial Plotter.

Independent research points:
- What is an interrupt?
- What are callback functions?
- What are the different types of interrupt triggers?

## Motor Controller Interface

Get week 5's code and refactor it.

Independent research points:
- What is a function?
- Why should we use functions?
- What are code smells?
- What is refactoring?

## IRL Servo Demo

## IRL Compass Demo
